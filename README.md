# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

An educator since 2007 currently employed as the Systems & Programs Coordinator at Georgia Cyber Academy. As the Systems & Programs Coordinator, my responsibilities include serving as our District Learning Management Systems Administrator, Integrations Specialist, and Project Coordinator.
In an effort to better serve our district by furthering my understanding of the integrations and enhancing our open-source resources, I recently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp Full-Stack Web Developer course with expected graduation June 2022.
